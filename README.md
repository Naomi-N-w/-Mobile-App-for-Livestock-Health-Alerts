# 🐄 AI-Based Livestock Health Monitoring System

+ An AI-powered system that monitors livestock (specifically cows) using physiological, behavioral, and environmental sensor data. The goal is to detect signs of illness early and assist farmers and veterinarians in making proactive health decisions through predictive analytics.

##  Overview

This project uses AI and sensor data to monitor livestock health. By analyzing time-series data collected from sensors on cows, the system predicts health conditions (healthy or sick) and sends alerts in real-time. This aids in early detection, reduces livestock mortality, and boosts farm productivity.


## 👥 Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholders

- **Farmers** – Real-time alerts reduce economic losses and improve herd health.
- **Veterinarians** – Receive predictive diagnostics for early intervention.
- **Agritech Firms** – Integration-ready models for smart farming.
- **NGOs / Policymakers** – Use insights for disease outbreak monitoring.
- **Investors** – Track ROI on AI-enhanced farming solutions.

### Dataset Description

- **Source**: Sensor logs from livestock
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours
- **Features**:
  - **Animal Info**: `cow_id`, `age_months`
  - **Environmental**: `ambient_temp_celsius`, `humidity_percent`
  - **Physiological**: `temperature_celsius`, `heart_rate_bpm`, `respiration_rate_bpm`
  - **Behavioral**: `activity_score`, `rumination_minutes_day`, `feed_intake_kg_day`, `water_intake_liters_day`
  - **Target Label**: `health_status` (healthy, sick)


##  Objectives

1. **Predictive Health Classification**  
   Classify livestock as healthy or sick with ≥90% accuracy using multivariate data.

2. **Real-Time Alerts**  
   Develop a web/mobile interface for health alerts to farmers and vets.

3. **Edge Deployment**  
   Ensure compatibility with edge devices like Raspberry Pi for on-field use.
